Many proteins shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in response to various signals and regulate a broad spectrum of biological processes. This dynamic transport process is mediated by the nuclear location signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES).NLS/NESs have been experimentally determined for fewer than 10% of known nuclear proteins, the majority of proteins do not have known or potential NLS/NES annotation. Here we developed a deep learning-based model to predict the nuclear location proteins, discovered complex biological rules to decipher protein nuclear location potential. Further, we developed iNuLoC to reveal the candidate regions that may be critical for protein nuclear localization.
